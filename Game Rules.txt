Setting up the Game:

- the 20 tile cards are placed on the table in a 5x4 grid (this is considered the board)
- randomly determine the staring position of the swarm and put it there
- shuffle event card pile and place it next to the board. (in front of the "seer" player if he participates in the game)
- shuffle the leader card pile and place it next to the board. (in front of the "tactician" player if he participates in the game)
- shuffle the covert card pile and place it next to the board.(in front of the "clandestine" player if he participates in the game)
- shuffle the quest card pile and place it next to the board. 
- shuffle the specialty card pile and keep it ready.
- shuffle the traitor card pile and keep it ready.
- set up event pile
	-shuffle the rain event cards and put 5 of them aside
	-take the non rain event cards and shuffle them together with the remaining rain event cards
	-take the 5 random rain event cards from before and put them on top of the other event cards



For each player:

- draw a card from the specialty card pile (and follow its game setup instructions if there are any)
- puts your 20 troops in your reserve
- receive 5 water
- draw four cards from the traitor card pile choose and keep one of them, the other 3 are removed from the game face down. (you are allowed to take notes of their names)
- put five of the troops from your reserve on a free tile

the youngest player starts and it is played counter clockwise

The game starts:

A Round:
 
Phase1: Event
- the start player token is moved depending on the swarm movement indicator 
	- east move token counter clockwise(e.g.: 2 east means the player second to the right of the previous start player gets the token)
	- west move token clock wise
	- north (neglect number) active player chooses another player to get the start token
	- south token stays where it is
- reveal the top card of the event card pile and follow its instructions
- the swarm moves according to the direction indicated on the event card by the amount of steps indicated by the number (for the swarm the map is wraparound). 
	all troops it passes through are killed (troops in bastions are not affected) (they go back to their players reserve)

Phase2: Trade
- players can trade information for water to each other
	(including showing a card to someone that he is not be allowed to look at but you are)
- when nobody wants to trade go to the next phase

Phase3: Movement
- each player 
 - drop: pay 2*x water in order to drop x troops from your reserve on a tile

- each player
 - move: pay 1 water to move a stack of troops one tile in any directon (not diagonal)
	- you are not allowed to move troops from a tile witch contains troops of other players
	- you can not move from or to a tile with the swarm


Phase4: Battles
-if there are anywhere troops of two or more different players on the same tile (exeption: sanctuary!)
a battle will take place

- if there are more than two players, the first player in turn order can decide who he wants to battle
	the Battle
	- each player chooses their comittment (number from 1-6 secretly, it has to be lower or equal to the number of troops he fields for battle)
	- each player chooses a leader and up to one tactics card secretly such as a number lower or equal to their troopcount
	- both players turn their chosen cards face up at the same time
	- should somebody have a traitor card that matches one of the leaders and chooses to play it, the respective leader is removed from the game
		and his army goes back to the reserve
	- the leader elements are compared
		- if an element is weak to the other its leader has no effect in this battle
		- leaders have one of 4 elements: fire earth wind or water
		- fire > wind > earth > fire
		- water cannot be countered by any element
	- now for both players the battle score is calculated:
		comittment + leader skill (+1 if you are defending a bastion)
        - winner is the player with the higher resulting battle score on
	- the looser looses all troops (they go back to the reserve) 
	- the winner looses the amount of troops corresponding to his comittment
	- should they have the same battle score each player looses all troops

Phase5: Harvest
- for each troop on a tile that yields water their controller can grab one water and put it into their reserve
- the controller of a basin takes 2 water

Phase6: Auction
- the top card of the leaders card pile is put in the auction hall (face down)
	now players starting with the start player can bid water (taking turns) on the leader
- repeat this for a tactics card, quest card and the covert card


End of game:

the game ends when:


- a player manages to conquer 3 bastions (he wins the game)

- at the end of the round where the event card has been revealed that ends the game
	- nothing can be done now (no trading/ no playing of covert cards)
	-in this case count victory points for every player
		- each controlled city grants 1 victory point
		- in case there are multiple players even on points 

			tied players simultaneously play one of their leaders 
				-this works as a battle with 0 comittment (tile is dessert)
				
			repeat until there is a winner (each leader can only be used once)

		if there is no winner yet
			- first compare controlled cities
			- then compare water reserve
			- then compare number of quest cards
			- wtf just treat it as a draw
