Setting up the Game:

- the 20 tile cards are placed on the table in a 5x4 grid (this is considered the board)
- randomly determine the staring position of the swarm and put it there
- shuffle event card pile and place it next to the board. (in front of the "seer" player if he participates in the game)
- shuffle the leader card pile and place it next to the board. (in front of the "tactician" player if he participates in the game)
- shuffle the covert card pile and place it next to the board.(in front of the "clandestine" player if he participates in the game)
- shuffle the quest card pile and place it next to the board. 
- shuffle the specialty card pile and keep it ready.
- shuffle the traitor card pile and keep it ready.
- set up event pile
	-shuffle the rain event cards and put 5 of them aside
	-take the non rain event cards and shuffle them together with the remaining rain event cards
	-take the 5 random rain event cards from before and put them on top of the other event cards

For each player:
	- draw a card from the specialty card pile (and follow its game setup instructions if there are any)
	- draw a quest
	- puts your 15 troops in your reserve
	- receive 5 water
	- draw 4 cards from the traitor card pile choose and keep one of them, the other 3 are removed from the game face down. (you are allowed to take notes of their names)
	- put 5 of the troops from your reserve on a free tile

the youngest player starts as start player and gets the startplayer token (it is played counter clockwise)

General:

Trading:
- at any time players can make deals, and pay each other in water

Treason:
- at any point when a leader is showed doing an action, his traitor card can be played in order to remove that leader from the game



The game starts:

A Round:
 
Phase1: Event
- the start player token is moved depending on the swarm movement number
	- move token counter clockwise by the stated number in the event card (e.g.: 2 means the player second to the right of the previous start player gets the token)
- reveal the top card of the event card pile and follow its instructions
- the swarm moves according to the direction indicated on the event card by the amount of steps indicated by the number (for the swarm the map is wraparound). 
	all troops it passes through are killed (troops in bastions are not affected) (they go back to their players reserve)
- each player:
	Prayer:
	- decide wheather to not participate in movement, harvest and auction phase this round, if so put a troop from your reserve to a temple

Phase2: Movement
- each player 
 - drop: pay 2*x water in order to drop x troops from your reserve on the sanctuary or a tile occupied by you only. (not to the swarm tile)
		- you can also drop your troops from temples (the troops from temples don't have to be payed) (not to or from the swarm tile)

- each player
 - move: pay 1 water to move a stack of troops to an adjacent tile (not diagonal)
	- you are not allowed to move troops from a tile witch contains troops of other players
	- you can not move from or to a tile with the swarm


Phase3: Battles
-if there are anywhere troops of two or more different players on the same tile (exeption: sanctuary!)
a battle will take place

- if there are more than two players, the first player in turn order can decide who he wants to battle
	the Battle
	- each player chooses their comittment (number from 1-6 secretly, it has to be lower or equal to the number of troops he fields for battle)
	- each player chooses a leader and up to one tactics card secretly such as a number lower or equal to their troopcount
	- both players turn their chosen cards face up at the same time
	- treason: 	should somebody have a traitor card that matches one of the leaders and chooses to play it, the respective leader is removed from the game
		 	and his army goes back to the reserve (the battle ends)
	- the leader elements are compared
		- if the element of a leader is weak to the element of the other leader, that leader is considered countered in this battle 
			- leaders have one of 4 elements: fire earth wind or water
			- fire > earth > water > fire
		- wind is neutral (does not counter nor is counterd by another element)
	- now for both players the battle score is calculated:
		comittment + leader skill(only if not countered) + 1 if defending a bastion
        - winner is the player with the higher resulting battle score
	- should they have the same battle score each player looses all troops
	- the looser looses all troops (they go back to the reserve) 
	- the winner looses the amount of troops corresponding to his comittment
	- the winner may put one troop from his reserve to the temple corresponding to his generals element
	

Phase4: Harvest
-for each player:
	- for each troop on a tile that yields water grab 1 water and put it into your reserve
	- if you control a basin take 2 water

Phase5: Auction
- the top card of the quest card pile is put in the auction hall (face down)
	now players starting with the start player can bid water (taking turns) on that card
- repeat this for a leader and a covert card


End of game:

the game ends when:


- a player manages to conquer 3 bastions (he wins the game)

- at the end of the round where the event card has been revealed that ends the game
	- nothing can be done now (no trading/ no playing of covert cards)
	-in this case count victory points for every player
		- each controlled city grants 1 victory point
		- in case there are multiple players even on points 

			tied players simultaneously play one of their leaders 
				-this works as a battle with 0 comittment (tile is dessert)
				
			repeat until there is a winner (each leader can only be used once)

		if there is no winner yet
			- first compare controlled cities
			- then compare water reserve
			- then compare number of quest cards
			- wtf just treat it as a draw
